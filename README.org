These are my solutions for the [[http://adventofcode.com/2017/][Advent of Code 2017]]! 🎉

I will most likely be using the following languages:

- 👾 Scheme, because I 💘 Lisp and want to get better at it.
- 🦋 Perl 6 when I'm feeling particularly adventurous.
- 🐪 Perl 5 when I'm feeling lazy or when time's running out :-)
